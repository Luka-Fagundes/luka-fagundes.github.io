        <h3 id="about">About Me</h3>
        <p>Nevada native turned Louisiana import. I gradutated highschool at Natchitoches Central, and am currently enrolled in Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, LA. My degree program is in business, and with enrolling in the online
          program I have been able to work full time during my studies. I began coding little while ago and have found that I enjoy it throughly, and the material comes very natural to me. What I lack in experience, I believe I more than make up for
          in my ability to learn what I need to know quickly and correctly, as well as retain that information to use in the future.</p>
        <p>In my personal life I like to do the things I true enjoy. Video games have always been a love of mine, and concerts are very close second. Usually after work I'll play a few hours, have some dinner, pet my dog, hang out with my friends,
          and enjoy all of the little moments in between. </p>
        <p>Some past work expierinences I've had, although non-development in nature, I feel speaks strongly to my work ethic, as well as what I am capable of. During my seven years at a local resataurant I learned several important qualities such as
          multi-tasking, information retension, managing a staff of people, and managing assetts, time, and money. During five and a half years as a Customer Service Representative at an insurance tracking firm I was able to learn the importance of
          certain processes, maintaing a regular schedule of events, handling sensitive information both incoming and outgoing, and speaking with customers who only call yelling and screaming. I cannot go into the specifics of this job as there is an
          NDA ineffect, but the values and traits learned there will carry with me. </p>

      <p>I am self-taught and have been using <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freecodecamp</a> as my primary learning tool, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a> and <a
          href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stackoverflow</a>. Listed below contain the projects I've created as necessary to receive certification for HTML and CSS coding, with this website serving as the final project for said
        certification. As I begin working more and create more projects I will continue to update this list.</p>
      <p>As you move down the list you'll see how my understanding goes from a very basic level to much more complicated elements.</p>
